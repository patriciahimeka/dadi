# dadi
This repositoryt links scripts used for demographic analysis in dadi to the manuscript "The oceanographic isolation of the Ogasawara Islands and genetic divergence in a reef-building coral" (in prep.) for reproducibility. 

All scripts rely heavily on the dadi_pipeline established by Dan Portik: https://github.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline
(pipeline version for python 2.7, from 2018). Follow the link to see details to demographic modeling with dadi.
