# dadi
This repositoryt links scripts used for demographic analysis in dadi to the manuscript "The oceanographic isolation of the Ogasawara Islands and genetic divergence in a reef-building coral" (in prep.) for reproducibility. 

All scripts heavily rely on the dadi_pipeline established by Dan Portik available here: https://github.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline
(pipeline versions from 2018). Please see details to demographic modeling with dadi.
