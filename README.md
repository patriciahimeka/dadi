# dadi
This repositoryt links scripts used for demographic analysis in dadi to the manuscript "The oceanographic isolation of the Ogasawara Islands and genetic divergence in a reef-building coral" (in prep.).

All scripts rely heavily on previous work by Dan Portik available here: https://github.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline
